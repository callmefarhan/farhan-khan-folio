          I'm someone who believes that meaningful tech starts with purpose.
          Whether it's crafting a web app, optimizing data flow, or reimagining everyday experiences with AI, 
          I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, effective solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="fade-in text-lg leading-relaxed" style={{ animationDelay: "0.4s" }}>
          I've worked on projects ranging from career counseling platforms to athlete performance tracking apps â€” 
          all with a deep interest in how users interact with technology.
        </p>
        <p className="fade-in text-lg leading-relaxed" style={{ animationDelay: "0.6s" }}>
          I love learning new tech stacks, experimenting with design, and occasionally diving into the world of 
          social media, networking, and storytelling.
