          I'm someone who believes that meaningful tech starts with purpose.
          Whether it's crafting a web app, optimizing data flow, or reimagining everyday experiences with AI, 
          I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, effective solutions.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed reveal-text">
          I've worked on projects ranging from career counseling platforms to athlete performance tracking apps â€” 
          all with a deep interest in how users interact with technology.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed reveal-text">
          I love learning new tech stacks, experimenting with design, and occasionally diving into the world of 
          social media, networking, and storytelling.
